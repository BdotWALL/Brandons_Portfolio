            <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    Traveling is a huge personal interest of mine. I have a passion for exploring and expierencing new places and 
                    learning about the culture. I'm also a huge sports fan; I enjoy watching/playing all sports but basketball has 
                    my heart for sure. I'm an avid Duke Blue Devils and Chicago Bulls fan. I would like to make it to
                    more sporting events, that is a goal of mine. Art and music are two more very important interests of
                    mine. I enjoy all aspects of music - recording, mixing and mastering, listening, and attending concerts/shows.
